//! Augmented ARMv7M operations
//!
//! # Interrupt management
//!
//! The `enable_irq`, `disable_irq`, and `clear_pending_irq` functions provide
//! enhanced atomic interrupt status management. The equivalent operations from
//! the `cortex_m` crate do not guarantee atomicity. For example, when disabling
//! an interrupt, the interrupt *can still fire* after `disable` returns,
//! because `disable` does not use the correct memory barrier instructions.
//! `disable_irq` fixes this, and so for the other functions in this module.
//!
//! The methods used are derived from the ARM document *ARM Cortex-M Programming
//! Guide to Memory Barrier Instructions*.

/// priority masks and caller interrupt priority allowing, the ISR will have had
/// an opportunity to execute by the time this function returns.
///
/// If the interrupt was already enabled, this is a no-op.
