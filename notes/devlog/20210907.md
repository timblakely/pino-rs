# Heaps and heaps of heaps

Back at it. Ended up spending waaay to much time tracking down yet another `ID10-T` error
- After implementing the heap (I'll get to that in a bit), I noticed I was unable to send CAN messages to the board
- Git bisecting showed that it was due to a specific commit, but I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out what it had to do with FDCAN
  - ... turns out it had nothing to do with it at all, actually.
- I tried to put a breakpoint into the main loop inside the `Driver` but oddly it never got hit ?!
  - The `ADC1_2` interrupt was firing alright. I've got a simple bit-banged GPIO LED indicator with a few `nop`s between on and off, and it was turning on fine
  - It did seem a bit brighter than normal so I probed it: Ayup, duty cycle was like 40%, going at ~1MHz. Wat.
- Looked like `ADC1_2` IRQ was continuously firing at ~1MHz
  - It _should_ have been sync'd to `TIM1` which is firing at 40kHz. This usually means that I'm not clearing an IRQ flag
  - ... but I was? `clear_pending_irq(device::Interrupt::ADC1_2);` was literally the first line of the interrupt handler. What gives?
- Spent like three hours tracking it down
  - Did I miss-configure the `TIM1` trigger? Nope
  - Was the IRQ flag not being cleared in the `NVIC`? Nope
  - Was I doing something wrong in the new `InterruptBLock` synchronization primitive? Not as far as I could tell
- Finally tracked the 40kHz->1MHz cause down to a single, seemingly-innocuous line: `let _foo = hardware.current_sensor.sample();`
  - Wat. Oh... yeah, that'll do it:

    ```rust
    // Clear the EOS flag from ADC1, what we're using to trigger the control loop interrupt.
    // Note: `clear()` is a bad name, since it doesn't clear the _bit_, but clears the _flag_ by
    // writing a 1.
    sensor.phase_a.isr.modify(|_, w| w.eos().clear());
    ```
  - Turns out while I was acknowledging that the interrupt had been handled to the `NVIC`, the `ADC1` peripheral continued to signal to the `NVIC` that there's an "end of sampling" interrupt that needed to be handled

Phew. Now back to the heap Wait, heap? Aren't those bad in embedded systems?
- Yes and no. [Fragmentation](https://www.embedded.com/dynamic-memory-and-heap-contiguity/) is problematic on memory-constrained systems, but there are [strategies to deal with it](https://www.iar.com/knowledge/learn/programming/mastering-stack-and-heap-for-system-reliability/)
- Rust's core/`no_std` libs don't support heap allocation out of the box
  - This is generally A Good Thing:tm:, since you can be sure any library you depend on won't magically start allocating stuff and eating precious memory
  - That also means essentially everything has to have a `'static` lifetime
- For example, say you wanted to have a `ControlLoop` `trait` where any class that implemented it could be swapped in and executed during the 40kHz control loop:

  ```rust
  pub trait ControlLoop: Send + Sync {
      fn commutate(&mut self, current_sensor: &CurrentSensor<current_sensing::Sampling>)
          -> LoopState;
      fn finished(&self) {}
  }
  ```

  - Theoretically all you'd have to do is `impl ControlLoop` and then pass it around as a `dyn ControlLoop`, but therein lies the problem: trait objects are [fat pointers](https://guihao-liang.github.io/2020/06/06/fat-pointer)
- There are (currently) [a few ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26212397/references-to-traits-in-structs) to store trait objects in structs for later use:
  - References: requires lifetime propagation, and if you store them in a global `static` object all fields inside must be `'static` since you [can't declare a custom lifetime on one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40053550/the-compiler-suggests-i-add-a-static-lifetime-because-the-parameter-type-may-no). In other words, [_"Every type has an implicit `'static` lifetime if no generic lifetime is specified"_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59773865/can-static-be-placed-along-the-struct-declaration)
    - Aside from some terribly `unsafe` code that introduces quite a bit of UB and makes some assumptions about the format/layout of both the fat pointer and the vtable, there's no easy way to get something from main code into an interrupt handler
  - Enums (`enum People { Grandma(Grandma), Son(Son) } ` trick) - Not bad, but not very generic, requires a decent amount of boilerplate, and enum variants don't (yet) have their own types. Overall code smell
  - `Box`es - Simple, but requires heap
  - Transforming a `FnMut` into an `fn`, but that precludes capturing any variables inside of the closure
- Changing the commutation loop on the fly is my main use case: swapping between calibration, encoder testing, inductance/resistance measurement, etc on the fly via FDCAN commands
  - Since the scope of the trait object use case is small, going to run with the [alloc-cortex-m](https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m) crate
  - Unfortunately it just uses a [linked-list allocator which is pretty prone to fragmentation](https://github.com/rust-embedded/alloc-cortex-m/issues/36), so I'm going to monkey-patch in a [Two-Layer Segregated Fit heap](https://github.com/yvt/rlsf/tree/main/crates/rlsf)

Onto implementation details
