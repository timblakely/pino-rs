# Reworking FDCAN

I'm really struggling to figure out the right API for the FDCAN. I tried something like this:

```rust
// Serialized/wire data
pub struct ReceivedMessage {
    pub id: u32,
    pub data: [u32; 16],
}

pub trait ExtendedFdcanFrame {
    // Unique ID for the frame
    fn id(&self) -> u32;

    // Unpack the message from a buffer.
    fn unpack(buffer: &[u32; 16]) -> Self;

    // Pack the message into a buffer of up to 64 bytes, returning the number of bytes that were
    // packed.
    fn pack(&self, buffer: &mut [u32; 16]) -> u8;
}

pub trait FdcanMessageTranslator {
    // Unique ID for the frame
    fn id(&self) -> u32;

    // Unpack the message from a buffer.
    fn unpack(message: &ReceivedMessage) -> Option<Self>
    where
        Self: Sized;

    // Pack the message into a buffer of up to 64 bytes, returning the number of bytes that were
    // packed.
    fn pack(&self, buffer: &mut [u32; 16]) -> u8;
}

pub struct Debug {
    pub foo: u32,
    pub bar: f32,
    pub baz: u8,
    pub toot: [u8; 3],
}

impl ExtendedFdcanFrame for Debug {
    fn id(&self) -> u32 {
        0xA
    }

    fn unpack(buffer: &[u32; 16]) -> Debug {
        Debug {
            foo: buffer[0],
            bar: f32::from_bits(buffer[0]),
            baz: (buffer[2] >> 24) as u8,
            toot: [
                ((buffer[2] & (0xFF << 16)) >> 16) as u8,
                ((buffer[2] & (0xFF << 8)) >> 8) as u8,
                (buffer[2] & 0xFF) as u8,
            ],
        }
    }

    fn pack(&self, buffer: &mut [u32; 16]) -> u8 {
        buffer[0] = self.foo;
        buffer[1] = self.bar.to_bits();
        buffer[2] = (self.baz as u32) << 24
            | (self.toot[2] as u32) << 16
            | (self.toot[1] as u32) << 8
            | (self.toot[0] as u32);
        24
    }
}

pub struct Debug2 {
    pub first: u32,
    pub second: i32,
}

impl ExtendedFdcanFrame for Debug2 {
    fn id(&self) -> u32 {
        0xB
    }

    fn unpack(buffer: &[u32; 16]) -> Debug2 {
        Debug2 {
            first: buffer[0] as u32,
            second: buffer[1] as i32,
        }
    }

    fn pack(&self, buffer: &mut [u32; 16]) -> u8 {
        buffer[0] = self.first as u32;
        buffer[1] = self.second as u32;
        8
    }
}

enum Messages {
    Debug(Debug),
    Debug2(Debug2),
}

impl FdcanMessageTranslator for Messages {
    fn id(&self) -> u32 {
        match self {
            Self::Debug(x) => x.id(),
            Self::Debug2(x) => x.id(),
        }
    }

    fn unpack(message: &ReceivedMessage) -> Option<Self> {
        match message.id {
            0xA => Some(Messages::Debug(Debug::unpack(&message.data))),
            0xB => Some(Messages::Debug2(Debug2::unpack(&message.data))),
            _ => None,
        }
    }

    fn pack(&self, buffer: &mut [u32; 16]) -> u8 {
        match self {
            Self::Debug(x) => x.pack(buffer),
            Self::Debug2(x) => x.pack(buffer),
        }
    }
}
```

But the double-indirection through `Messages` felt kinda wrong. Though it _did_ allow me to `match`
on it...

- Moving towards something I think it probably pretty sane for now: a modification of the above but
  getting rid of the `FdcanMessageTranslator` trait; the peripheral doesn't need to know about it
- Hm, not seeing the right values when unpacking...?
  - Checking the RXFIFO0 in FDCAN SRAM I see the right values that I sent via [fdcanusb](https://github.com/mjbots/fdcanusb)
  - So suggests it's downstream oddness somewhere
  - WAITWAITWAITWAIT... Ugh. It works perfectly. I was using Python's `struct.pack`, but it was
    packing to _native_ sizes... aka 64 bit :facepalm:
- And it works. We'll see if this is the right API. Anyway... now to commutation

**Problem:** need to get the control parameters from the main control loop (where the instructions come
in over FDCAN) and into the control loop.

- Can't use a read/write lock, since that'd deadlock in the ISR
- Can't disable interrupts (e.g. via critical sections) since we can't change the control loop frequency
- First thought: transactional (exclusive buffer?) lock
  - Requires two buffers: the main thread writes to one and the ISR reads from the other
  - Who reads from what is controlled by the main thread, since it's sending data to the ISR and
    the ISR can preempt
  - I think this can be accomplished via an atomic compare/exchange
