# Crappy power supplies, part deux

Had a shower thought this morning that the noise might be due to my power supply just EMR radiating 60Hz
noise, but nope, moving it away didn't help. Just probed the outputs and there's some serious 60Hz
noise coming through (tens-hundreds of mA, scope can't go that high).

Okay, new power supply ordered. Hopefully that will fix the noise on the current sense resistor and
main power supply. If not... well, we'll worry about that if (when) it happens.

In the meantime, can concentrate on the PI controller design, and just assume a few of the
parameters for now until I can actually measure 'em.
