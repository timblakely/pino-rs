# Part 25 - [Three equivalent representations of Linear Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HasvumXl_vE&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m&index=25)

Going to move away from ODE format and move towards transfer functions

In the abstract, a linear dynamic system just takes inputs, does a thing, and produces outputs
- Might not know exactly what's going on under the hood
