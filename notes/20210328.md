- Now that I have clock configuration working, going to make it a bit Rust-y
  - Sequestering clock setup akin to `m4vga-rs`
    - Probably overkill for this since there's only going to be one clock configuration, unlike `m4vga-rs` what needs to suppor 800x600, 640x480, variable pixel clocks, etc
    - Might come in handy during the eventual switch to the H7 though
