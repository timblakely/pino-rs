# It's a mystery

I'll let Jack take it from here...

`s/rum/noise/`

I cannot, for the life of me, reproduce the noise on the current sense B line. Only thing I can
think of is that the 2.84MHz noise was coming from some switching going on in the power supply at a
certain level...?

Idea for control loop: `Some<Fn(...)->ControlStatus>` for control loop callback, where
`ControlStatus` is enum `Continue` or `Finished`. That way we can set the control loop temporarily
e.g. during calibration, and have the control loop stop itself
- This would likely require a call to something like:
```rust
driver.with_control(|...| {
  // Do whatever with the controller here
  if done {
    return Finished;
  }
  Continue
}, Some(|...| {
  // This Optional callback is called when commutation is finished, e.g. to respond over CAN with
  // calibration values, or to clean up any extra peripherals we might have used like TIM16 or
  // something
}))
```
