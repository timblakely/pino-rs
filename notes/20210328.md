- Now that I have clock configuration working, going to make it a bit Rust-y
  - Sequestering clock setup akin to `m4vga-rs`
    - Probably overkill for this since there's only going to be one clock configuration, unlike `m4vga-rs` what needs to suppor 800x600, 640x480, variable pixel clocks, etc
    - Might come in handy during the eventual switch to the H7 though

- Thinking about how a memory-mapped wrapper type would work for the various FDCAN buffers
  - Turns out the easiest way to get an `&mut` reference to something might be _to create a new reference to it to begin with!_
    - Seems to be how a large part of the `stm32-rs` library gets around only having 2x references to `unsafe` in the entire `generics.rs` file
    - Example:
      ```
      pub fn write_with_zero<F>(&self, f: F)
      where
          F: FnOnce(&mut W<U, Self>) -> &mut W<U, Self>
      {
          self.register.set(f(&mut W {bits: U::default(), _reg: marker::PhantomData }).bits);
      }
      ```
      - Note that the `self` _isn't_ `mut`, but somehow we still set the bits. 
  - Digging into the `stm32-rs` code a bit more
    - It seems the idiomatic way there is to have a `RegisterBlock` for each peripheral that contain `pub register: REGISTER_STRUCT` fields, interspersed with `_reservedN: [u8; 4usize]`
    - `device::Peripherals` has an `impl` of `take()`, which in turn calls `steal()`
      - Former is checked, the latter isn't (`unsafe fn`)
    - `steal()` creates a new `Peripherals` object with each peripheral in turn created with a `_marker: PhantomData` e.g. `RCC: RCC { _marker: PhantomData }`
    - `RCC` in turn is just an empty struct that has a single `impl`:
      ```
      impl RCC {
        #[inline(always)]
        pub const fn ptr() -> *const rcc::RegisterBlock {
          0x4002_1000 as *const _
        }
      }
      ```
      - Interesting that that isn't `unsafe`, but then again I guess it's not actually doing anything unsafe, just returning a pointer
    - It _also_ implements `Deref`, which is the dangerous `unsafe` part: it "creates" and object out of existing memory - which is exactly what I want for a memory-mapped object :)
      ```
      impl Deref for RCC {
        type Target = rcc::RegisterBlock;
        #[inline(always)]
        fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
          unsafe { &*RCC::ptr() }
        }
      }
      ```
    - This is the magic; it dereferences into an entirely different type!
    - Allows us to instantiate the the struct via `RCC { _marker: PhantomData }`, but when dereferencing it we get back the actual `RegisterBlock` struct as it was in memory
  - Now looking at the registers themselves
    - `RegisterBlock` is `#[repr(C)]
    - Type is defined as `pub type NAME = crate::Reg<u32, _NAME>`
      - `_NAME` appears to be a placeholder type. AFAICT it's never actually used
        - Could be for liftime checking? Will have to try that
      - `Reg<U, REG>` contains `register: vcell::VolatileCell<U>` and a `PhantomData<REG>`
        - Again for lifetime checking, probably
      - `Reg` implements `Send`
      - `NAME` itself implements `Readable`/`Writable` traits
      - Read/write/reset are implemented as traits on `NAME`
        - The actual implementations don't have anything inside them; the functions are defined on the trait themselves
        - Interesting way to share code... will have to keep that in mind
  - Each register has a read proxy and a write proxy: `pub type R = crate::R<u32, super::NAME>`
    - `super` because it's in its own `.rs` file (module)
    - `enum`s use `impl From` to convert from the underlying `u8`/`u16`/`u32` type
    - Each field can have a `pub type FIELD_R = crate::R<u8, u8>` read/write proxy as well 
    - Field `impl`s are pretty slick: they always return an `&'a mut W`, which is a write proxy to the _register itself_ and not the field. That means after selecting a field and modifying it, you can chain fields together
      ```
      impl<'a> I2C4SEL_W<'a> {
          ///Writes raw bits to the field
          #[inline(always)]
          pub unsafe fn bits(self, value: u8) -> &'a mut W {
              self.w.bits = (self.w.bits & !0x03) | ((value as u32) & 0x03);
              self.w
          }
      }
      ```
    - And you create each field by _giving it the register write proxy_:
      ```
      pub struct I2C4SEL_W<'a> {
          w: &'a mut W,
      }
      ```
      - Makes sense in a way; you need to be able to modify the specific bit fields without affecting the rest of fields/bits
    - Finally, the `R` and `W` register proxies have the individual fields defined
      - Readers via:
        ```
        pub fn field(&self) -> FIELD_R {
          FIELD_R::new((self.bits & 0x03) as u8)
        }
        ```
        - Note that they copy the register value over and over again as it passes through the chain. Which is good, since the chain can eventually be optimized down to a single write operation (assuming there's no capturing closures)
        - Only written once the closure passed to `.write()` or `.modify()` returns
  - Looking back on it, I think the reason the empty `_REGNAME` is passed around is to tie the lifetimes of all the various read/write proxies together
