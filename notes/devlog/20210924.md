# Closer to FoC

First up is moving away from the interrupt-driven angle calculation and instead towards a polling model. Done

Was trying to figure out why Ben was [casting the raw 0-1 encoder reading to an int prior to conversion to radians](https://github.com/bgkatz/motorcontrol/blob/2fa6cabbebcb19efb9d6b2dd0f59edc3537ad64f/Core/Src/position_sensor.c#L52)
  - I _think_ it has to do with the fact that you can set the mechanical zero (`M_ZERO` in his code) to any value within the range which can result in negative values, so it normalizes the corrected value from 0-1
- Interesting that he has an electric zero and mechanical zero separated

Now I guess all that's left is FOC...?
- I guess I do have to get the CORDIC calculations done, so I guess that comes first
