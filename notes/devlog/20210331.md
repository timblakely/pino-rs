- More work on FDCAN
  - Finished in memory representations, onto actual device.
  - Added a dependence on `static_asserts` to make sure `SramBlock` was the size I was expecting it
    to be (it was, woo!)
  - I like the idea of being able to chain functions, like `.set_extended_filter(...).set_filter(...)`, etc

- Before I blinky, I need to giture out how to get GPIOs working
  - Looked at the `stm32-rs/stm32g4xx-hal`, but not convinced yet that it's the right approach
    - Doesn't appear to protect against mis-using alternate functions... will have to look into that
    - Guess I should try it; it's stupid easy to use external crates in Rust :)
    - Yup, I think it's just plain broken now. Moving right along...
  - Going to forgo the wrapper for now; need to test to see if I can get blinky working correctly
  - Actually, saw a reply to my github pull request for rcc. Will work 
  - Made some tweaks to GPIO. Man, the state of STM32's SVDs is just... _atrocious_
