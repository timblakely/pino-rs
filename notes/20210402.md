- Came out of my April Fools day hole... man am I guillable
- Taking the implementation of the controller somewhat slow; trying to get a feel for "best practices" in Rust along the way
  - Taking significant lessons from `m4vga-rs`, possibly to the detriment of complexity :)
- Man, I'm kinda amazed at how easy it is with `stm32-rs` to, in effectively one commit:
  1. Add or correct a field in the SVD file via a simple YAML file (effectively the only coding part) 
  2. Generate a corrected SVD file (automatic)
  3. Generate type-safe, auto-complete-able, compiles-down-to-a-single-instruction struct wrapping the update (automatic)
  4. Pull it into your current project (automatic)
