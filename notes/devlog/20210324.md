- Simple debugging session up and running in Rust
  - Looks like the default for OpenOCD is to run the adapter at 2MHz (!)
  - Switching the adapter speed to 24000 MHz works initially, but the `stm32g4x.cfg` config sets the following on `configure reset-start`, which might drop adapter speed when debugging
    ```
    $_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-start {
      # Reset clock is HSI (16 MHz)
      adapter speed 2000
    }
    ```
  - Forked the config, overrode in both places to 24MHz
  - Wow... a lot faster debugging now, especially when stepping over
- Getting semihosting up and running
  - Debugging won't attach correctly with `cortex-debug`'s basic configuration of `swoConfig`
    - Actually won't even boot correctly with it enabled
    - Wait, actually it does... when I tried running the adapter at 16MHz instead of 24MHz
      - Guess that kinda makes sense, the CPU on boot is at a lowly 16MHz itself
      - Actually kicks it down to 8MHz adapter speed...? Whatever
  - Semihosting works! "Hello world!" Achieved! :tada:
    - Needed to add `preLaunchCommand: monitor arm semihosting enable` to the launch config
    - Apparently doesn't even use the `swoConfig` at all :zany_face:

- Now onto the various crates!
