# Reworking to be more Rusty

I've spent quite a bit twiddling registers. While that's needed to get the control loop up and running, that's not exactly why Rust is awesome. I'm going to work on getting the FDCAN comms up to date so I can actually send signals to the board instead of having to recompile and reflash.

- Attempting to move the FDCAN message handling into a callback in the controller
  - I think I may have one level too many of indirection in the FDCAN messages
  - We've got the struct `ReceivedMessage`, the trait `ExtendedFdcanFrame` and each implemented struct, e.g. `DebugMessage`
  - I wonder if I'm trying to do too much reflection here...?
