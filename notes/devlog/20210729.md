## SysTick

Need a blocking wait for the ADC calibrations from [yesterday](./20210728.md). Will try to use SysTick instead of sacrificing a timer.

- I don't want to pay for the overhead of an interrupt every tick and want to see if we can get microsecond resolution
  - Got the peripheral up and running, but seems mis-calibrated; 5e6 micros lasted less than a second...?
  - Oh, turns out I was calculating it assuming the timer was counting micros, not clock cycles
- There's a bit of subtlety to blocking for microseconds
  - SysTick is 24 bit, which means the maximum number of ticks before we hit the wrap bit is 2^24
  - If we want to sleep for something like 1s, we need to account for multiple loops
