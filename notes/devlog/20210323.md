- Started exploring [m4vga-rs](https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vga-rs)
  - Tried to get compiling; no dice
    - Doesn't work at HEAD
    - Took entirely too long to realize that there was a switch in rust from gcc-arm-none-eabi-ld to LLVM's LLD
    - `INSERT AFTER` `SECTION`s are actually [reversed in LLD](https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg753671.html)
      - [Relevant line](https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vga-rs/blob/master/m4vga/memory.x#L51)
  - Picked up a few release flags for Rust (Cargo.toml)
    ```
    [profile.release]
    codegen-units = 1 # better optimizations
    debug = true # symbols are nice and they don't increase the size on Flash
    lto = true # better optimizations
    ```
