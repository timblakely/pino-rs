# We now return you to our regularly scheduled bot

Okay, I've been quite lax in self-documentation recently. Time to fix that!

I'm working on organizing my Rust workspace now. I've mainly been talking to the BLDC via Python->PySerial->FDCANUSB->BLDC, but something in that loop is causing some pretty serious latency, to the point where I can only poll at like 45Hz. That's waaaay too slow for any kind of monitoring. I suspect it's somewhere in Python+PySerial, so I'd like to cut that out of the loop. Then it hit me: if I like Rust so much, why not do the serial communication from Rust?
- First stab was the [serial](https://crates.io/crates/serial) crate. Buuuut turns out that hasn't been updated in 4+ years and is pretty out of date with modern Rust
- Next try is with [serialport](https://crates.io/crates/serialport). Better so far
- Also needed an `argparse` for Rust. [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) to the rescue!
  - The base configuration is a bit verbose/unwieldy, but it'll do for now.
  - [clap_derive](https://crates.io/crates/clap_derive) might help with that
