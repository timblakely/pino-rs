# Probe grounding

Based on [this
post](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/136123/how-do-you-attach-an-oscilloscope-ground-spring),
an interesting part to potentially build into boards for truly grounded probe testing is
[MMCX](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?FV=fff40016%2Cfff8051a&k=MMCX&mnonly=0&newproducts=0&ColumnSort=1000011&page=1&stock=1&pbfree=0&rohs=0&quantity=&ptm=0&fid=0&pageSize=250)
connectors. From there you can get some [premade MMXC->SMA
pigtails](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en/cable-assemblies/coaxial-cables-rf/1573243?k=MMCX)
(and subsequently convert to [BNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_connector)) for pretty cheap. Neat
