## Current sensing, round 2

- Okay, so gotta get current sensing running correctly
  - Reading 1.81V on the SOA line, regardless of whether the phases were actually going ...?
  - OH. Wait. I think something's messed up with my blocking sleep?
  - Ayup, broken SysTick. Note to self: Timer's don't reset themselves
    - SysTick was keeping the previous countdown value from the last time the timer was used
    - It counts _down_, which meant that when I was trying to sleep 200us for the ADC calibration it was actually only sleeping for <= the ~20us from the ADC power up
    - Huh, I'll bet that's the cause of why the DRV didn't work in Release mode: wasn't getting enough time to start up...
      - Nope, not the case :/
  - Now that the DRV is properly sleeping for 200us (really required only 100us), current sense amplifier values are spot on.
- Hand-calculating the DRV current now with an SOA reading of 1.71V for a duty cycle of 1.88%
  - $I=\frac{\frac{V_{vref}}{2} - V_{SO_x}}{G_{CSA}\times R_{SENSE}} = \frac{\frac{3.3}{2} - 1.71}{40\times 0.001}=\dots -1.5A$
  - At a gain of 40, that means every hundredth of a volt corresponds to 0.25A
    - TODO(blakely): Might have to tweak that down to 20
- Finally, reading via ADC at the above settings gives us a reading of... 0x7f6
  - That doesn't make sense. That's a reading of about 1.65V or... nothing.
    - I'm only sampling for 2.5cycles, so let's bump that way up and see if that helps? Nope
  - Okay, I'm very likely sampling the wrong pin/channel. Double-checking
  - Oh, duh; it's not overwriting.
  - Okay, now actually reading. Seeing ranges of 0x82a-0x82f, corresponding to a range of 0.99107A-1.092A, or a noise of about 100mA. Not great, but not bad
    - That was with 640.5 clock cycles. Bringing it back down to the 2.5 gives... 0x82d-0x834
    - 1.051A-1.1931A is a bit higher (?)
- And bingo! Have current sampling!
  - Validation:
    - Reading adc:

      _(from STM32G474 datasheet)_

      $V_{ref\_calib}=3.0$
        - _Reference value used during testing at chip plant_

      $val_{refint\_calib_data}=0x67B$
        - _Value stored at `0x1FFF 75AA - 0x1FFF 75AB`_

      $val_{adc\_vrefint}=0x5DF$
        - _Value read from ADC that reads the $V_{refint}$_

      $val_{adc\_current}=0x82d$
        - _Value read from ADC that reads the SOA pin from the DRV_

      $V_{SOA\_ adc}=\frac{V_{ref\_calib} \times val_{refint\_calib_data} \times val_{adc\_vrefint}}{val_{adc\_current}\times 2^{12}}=\frac{3.0\times0x67B\times0x82d}{0x5DF\times4096}=1.692V$

      - Measured by scope: somewhere between 1.69-1.70V. Nailed it :thumbsup:

    - Converting to Current:

      $G_{csa}=40$
        - _DRV gain_

      $V_{vref}=3.3$
        - _Measured via scope_

      $V_{SOA\_ adc}=1.692V$
        - _From above_

      $R_{sense}=0.001\Omega$

      $I_{phase}=\frac{\frac{V_{vref}}{2}-V_{SOA}}{G_{csa}\times R_{sense}}=\frac{\frac{3.3}{2}-1.6945}{40\times 0.001}=1.05A$
        - So about 1.0A on the phase


    - Simulation: Assuming a single phase has $R_{phasex}=180m\Omega$ (based on [this Aliexpress listing](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32866434951.html))

      $V_{pulse}=24$
        - _Bus voltage_

      $Freq_{pwm}=40kHz=25000ns$

      $t_{pulse}=328ns$
        - _Measured from edge to edge across FET_

      $D=\frac{328}{25000}=0.01312$
        - _Actual duty cycle_

      $V_{dc}=V_{pulse}*D=24*0.1312=0.31488V$

      $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{V_{dc}}{R_{phasea} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{phaseb}}+\frac{1}{R_{phasec}}}}=\frac{0.31488}{180 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{0.180}+\frac{1}{0.180}}}=\frac{0.31488}{0.180 + 0.90}=\frac{0.31488}{0.270}\approxeq1.166A$
  - So off by approximately 100mA from ideal sim
    - Considering how many sources of error there were along the way, I'm pretty satisfied with that reading.
    - Also likely that the actual phase resistance is slightly higher. If we bump it up by $20m\Omega$ to $R_{phasex}=2000m\Omega$ we get $I=1.0496$.
    - Note that the biggest source of error was the ADC conversion, which seems to be pretty darn spot on to what I can probe
