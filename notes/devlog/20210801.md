Today's goal: Trigger CSA ADCs for conversion via TIM1_CH4

- Man, I really need to refactor these ADCs into their own structs... but will do that later.
- Trying to determine whether we need "continuous" or "discontinuous" mode. I _think_ we want
  discontinuous according to this figure:

  - Though then again maybe not, since discontinuous seems to be able to sample a subset of the sequence.
  - And even though we want to trigger on external signals, that's _technically_ not an _injected_ read
- Okay, have ADC1 started. Now to set TIM1_CH4 to output `trgo2` if we can.
