# Un-bricking STM32G4

Well that was scary. For some reason when Iw as flashing the chip it suddenly started saying "Error erasing flash with vFlashErase packet".
- Not sure what tripped it up, but no amount of disconnect/reconnecting or power cycling could revive the chip
- Thought I had fried it D:

Luckily I stumbled on [this thread](https://www.openstm32.org/forumthread2221) that had a solution:
- `openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f ~/git/rembed/tools/stm32g4x_custom.cfg` in one terminal to start OpenOCD session
- Then in another, run the following commands:

```
$ telnet localhost 4444
> reset halt
> flash probe 0
> flash protect 0 0 127 off
> exit
```

TL;DR: Somehow the flash protection got enabled, and the version of OpenOCD I'm using doesn't properly disable it before attempting to flash.
