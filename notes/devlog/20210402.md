- Came out of my April Fools day hole... man am I guillable
- Taking the implementation of the controller somewhat slow; trying to get a feel for "best practices" in Rust along the way
  - Taking significant lessons from `m4vga-rs`, possibly to the detriment of complexity :)
- Man, I'm kinda amazed at how easy it is with `stm32-rs` to, in effectively one commit:
  1. Add or correct a field in the SVD file via a simple YAML file (effectively the only coding part) 
  2. Generate a corrected SVD file (automatic)
  3. Generate type-safe, auto-complete-able, compiles-down-to-a-single-instruction struct wrapping the update (automatic)
  4. Pull it into your current project (automatic)
  - Okay, okay, so you have to restart the `rust-analyzer` plugin since the actual generated codebase is kinda huge :P

- Man, it's gonna take some time to wrap my head around lifetimes in Rust.
  - Was runnig into an issue with the typestate pattern where I was trying to give an instance of FDCAN's SRAM from `Fdcan<Init>` to a new `Fdcan<Running>`
  - The SRAM is actually `sram: &'static mut`, which means it's mutable and static for the entire lifetime of the program
    - In other words: can only make one reference to it at a time (which is **A Good Thing**)
  - However, I was running into an issue when creating the new `Fdcan<Running>` state
    - `pub fn start(&self) -> Fdcan<Running> { Fdcan { sram: self.sram, mode_state: Running } }` gave me _"Lifetime of a reference outlives the lifetime of borrowed content"_
    - ... but it should; it's `'static`?!
  - The compiler error gave me a pretty clear hint, but I wasn't thinking like a Rustacean:
    ```
    Compiling bldc v0.1.0 (/home/tim/git/rembed/bldc)
    error[E0312]: lifetime of reference outlives lifetime of borrowed content...

    note: ...but the borrowed content is only valid for the anonymous lifetime defined on the method body at 109:18

    ```
  - Thanks to `Marc` in [Discord](https://discord.gg/9qERHKsx) for pointing out my error:
    - _"Unlike shared references (`&`) unique references (`&mut`) aren't `Copy`."_
    - _"You're trying to hold multiple unique references to one thing for an indeterminate amount of time."_
    - _"Usually with the type state pattern your functions would consume the original value though."_
    - _"`pub fn start(self) -> Self { ... }`"_
    - _"Then you don't run into these issues."_
  - Gah, yup, that's exactly what I was missing; coming from C++ I completely spaced on the fact that _you can consume self, not just take references to it_
    - **Rust was actually correct**: I was trying to give a copy of the variable to another instance, which in Rust is **A Bad Thing** when you're talking about `&mut` references
  - Simple change to `pub fn start(&self)` to `pub fn start(self)` worked like a charm
  - Really nice to find language features that aren't only a solution to your problem _but match your mental model too_

- Man, macro import rules are weird
  - Spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why I couldn't import a macro across modules
  - Turns out _lexical order matters_ :zany_face:

- Boy, Rust _really_ makes you think about lifetimes. Like, a lot. Again, a good thing

- There's some really good stuff in `m4vga-rs` I think I'm actually going to lift some of it in a `third_party` crate (with attribution and `LICENSE`, of course!)
  - That was easy enough. Now we've got a `third_party` crate we can pull from 
  - `LICENSE` compliance is important!
