# Proper ADC reading

I've gotten pretty far just using the raw ADC peripherals, but I think it's time to make a small current sensing wrapper that has access to all the ADC bits we need.

I keep trying to re-invent the HAL. I see useful Rust-isms, but I really gotta focus on getting the BLDC control done before going all Rusty...

Okay, got ADC up and running. All you have to do is `current_sensor.sample()` and it'll return an `f32` voltage for `v_bus`, and a _calibrated_ phase currents for 1/2/3. Needs some cleaning up, but good enough for now.

I'm seeing fluctuations on the phase currents of around 0-0.18A. In the grand scheme of things this shouldn't matter too much, but I wonder how much more accurate I can get (need?). Let's try bumping the sampling period up a bit.
