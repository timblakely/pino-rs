- Seeing if I can import a device crate for the stm32g4
  - Installed the stm32g474 crate, but seems to need the `svd2rust` command too...?
  - Oh, apparently all that's needed is to `use stm32g4::stm32g474` and it links in the appropriate devices files
    - Nice that I don't have to build them locally (though I will eventually to bring in all the previous SVD patches I made in the C++ codebase)
- [Good post from `cbiffle`](https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vga-rs/blob/a1e2ba47eaeb4864f0d8b97637611d9460ce5c4d/notes/20190121.md) on using `cortex-m-rt` startup, and what it does _and doesn't do_ on startup
  - looks like it initializes `.bss` and `.data` _and_ enables the FPU
  - Man, his repo is a _gold mine_
    - Example: [trick](https://github.com/cbiffle/m4vga-rs/blob/master/doc/rust-port.md) to reduce binary size by dropping panic messages if you want by `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features panic-halt`

- Trying to get the panic handler to output over ITM
  - Oh, duh; it's in a different VSCode output terminal called `SWO: ITM Port 0` :zany_face:
  - Neat, so I got it to write out the panic'd message: `[2021-03-26T22:52:22.510Z]   panicked at 'Hello panic!', app/src/main.rs:21:5`
  - Looks like the adapter can run as fast as it wants, but the `"swoFrequency"` setting in `.launch.json` has to be set at `min(CPU_freq, swo_freq)`
